# Magento Module Fuzzer

----

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build an automated tool that uses a combination of introspection and user defined inputs in combination with pre-existing tools and fuzzing lists to automatically test Magento modules/extensions for vulnerabilities. The end goal would be that no extension, theme or custom module code sees production without being put thoroughly tested by this first. Recognizing the extremity of that ask, an intermediate goal would be that the this tool is used to test each extension before it is submitted to the Magento marketplace.
